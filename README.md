# CoinCollector
Coin Collector is a simple console-based game in C programming language. The game involves a player 'P' who moves around a game area to collect coins '+' while avoiding four enemies 'E'. The game area is a rectangular box with a border, and the player can move up, down, left, or right using the 'w', 's', 'a', and 'd' keys, respectively.

The game uses the 'conio.h' and 'windows.h' libraries to enable console output, hide the cursor, and set the console cursor's position. It also utilizes the 'stdlib.h' and 'time.h' libraries to generate random numbers for the coins' position.

The game has four enemies that move vertically within the game area. The game difficulty increases as the player collects more coins, which makes the enemies move faster. The game keeps track of the player's score and the elapsed time. The game ends when the player collides with any of the enemies.

This code can be used as an example for students learning C programming language or as a starting point for developing a simple console-based game.
